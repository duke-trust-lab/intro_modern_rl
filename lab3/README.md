# Lab 3
# Reward Design Lab

### Instructions:
Follow along with the worksheet packet handed out in class. You will turn this in at the end of class.

If following along virtually, you will find a PDF version of this packet in this repo and you can choose between the scenarios outlined in scenarios.md

### Objectives:
* Design reward functions for RL systems and explain their behavioral implications
* Anticipate unintended behaviors induced by reward optimization
* Diagnose and mitigate reward-design failures through adversarial critique
* Connect reward specification choices to real-world RL failures
