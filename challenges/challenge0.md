# Challenge 0. RL in the Real World

In this assignment, you will find real examples of reinforcement learning (RL) in the wild, analyze them using the concepts from class, and explain them clearly to your classmates.

**Teams of 2**

---

## Your Task

Find **one real-world example** where reinforcement learning is:

- Explicitly used  
- Claimed to be used  
- Or strongly implied  

Your example **must be real**. Acceptable sources include:

- Company engineering or research blog posts  
- Peer-reviewed papers or credible preprints  
- Technical case studies  
- Reputable news articles describing deployed systems  

**Not allowed:**

- Hypothetical ideas (“RL could be used for X”)  
- Toy environments (CartPole, Atari, GridWorld, etc.)  
- Pure marketing claims with no technical substance

## Part 1 – Decide on Your Example

Each example can **ONLY be used once**.  
The **first team to post on the Discussion board** gets the example. Make sure to confirm that your example has not already been chosen.

NA for those following along virtually.

## Part 2 – Do Your Research

For your chosen example, answer the following questions:

### 1. Source
Provide a link and a 1–2 sentence description of the system.

### 2. Claimed Use of RL?
What problem is reinforcement learning supposed to solve in this system?

### 3. Agent
What entity is making decisions?

### 4. Environment
What does the agent interact with?

### 5. Reward or Feedback Signal
What signal does the system actually receive?  
Is it a direct reward, a proxy metric, or delayed feedback?

### 6. Is This Really Reinforcement Learning?
Answer **Yes**, **No**, or **Unclear**, and justify your reasoning using concepts from class.

### 7. Real-World Constraints
Identify at least **two** real-world constraints that affect this system, such as:

- Safety or risk  
- Limited or delayed feedback  
- Restricted exploration  
- Human oversight  
- Legal or ethical constraints  
- Non-stationary environments  

### 8. Likely Failure Mode
Assuming the system optimizes its reward well, describe one likely failure mode or unintended behavior.

## Part 3 – Present to the Class

Present your answers in a **5–6 minute presentation**.

The **only deliverable** is the class presentation, so make sure it includes all components listed above.
