### Objectives:
* Train a baseline DQN on CartPole using RL Zoo 3 (a training harness around Stable-Baselines3).
* Diagnose stability by inspecting learning curves and evaluation performance.
* Implement and train Dueling DQN (an architecture change) using Stable-Baselines3 directly.
* On your own, implement Double DQN
